    "introduction": "### Rest for the Restless\n\nThe flight had been uneventful until the moment the captain announced from the flight deck that the plane would have to cross a major storm. “Please tighten your seat belts. We will be in for quite a ride,” the voice from the cockpit said in ending the announcement.\n\nSoon after, the plane began to shake violently as it fought its way through the storm. Overhead bins opened; people sat tense in their seats. After a particularly violent shudder of the plane, someone shrieked in the back of the plane. Images of a wing breaking off and the plane careening to the earth flashed through a few minds. All passengers looked tense and fearful—all except a little girl seated in the front row of economy. She was busy drawing a picture on the open tray table before her. Now and again she would look out the small window at a particularly impressive lightning strike, but then she would calmly resume her drawing.\n\nAfter what seemed half an eternity, the plane finally landed at its destination. Passengers cheered and clapped, so grateful and relieved to be back on the ground. The little girl had packed her bag and was waiting for people to leave the plane when one of the travelers asked her if she hadn’t been afraid. How could she be that calm during such a major storm and with the plane shaking so much?\n\n“I wasn’t scared,” the little girl said to the surprised man. “My dad is the pilot, and I knew he was taking me home.”\n\nRestlessness and fear often go hand in hand. Living in a world that keeps most people busy 24-7 can result in restlessness and fear in our lives. Who doesn’t, at times, struggle with fear, with worry, and with dread of what the future holds? The past is done, the present is now; but the future is full of questions, and in this unstable world, the answers might not be what we want to hear. We wonder if we will be able to make a looming deadline, to cover the next rent or school payment, or to make our struggling marriages survive another storm. We wonder if God can continue to love us, even though we “disappoint” Him again and again.\n\nIn this quarter, we will tackle some of those fears head on. Rest in Christ is not just a title for a study guide or the captivating logo of an evangelistic campaign or camp meeting. Resting in Christ is the key to the type of life that Jesus promises to His followers: “ ‘The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly’ ” (John 10:10, NKJV).\n\nAs the authors worked on this study guide, they suddenly realized the all-­pervasiveness of the concept of rest in the texture of biblical theology. Rest connects to salvation, to grace, to Creation, to the Sabbath, to our understanding of the state of the dead, to the soon coming of Jesus—and to so much more.\n\nWhen Jesus invited us to come and find rest in Him (Matt. 11:28), He not only addressed His disciples or the early Christian church. He also saw future generations of sin-sick, weary, worn-out, struggling human beings who needed access to the Source of rest. As you study the weekly lessons during this quarter, remember to come, and rest in Him. After all, our heavenly Father is in control and is ready to bring us home safely.\n\nChantal and Gerald Klingbeil enjoy a cross-cultural marriage and working as a team. Chantal, an associate director of the Ellen G. White Estate, hails from South Africa, while Gerald, an associate editor of Adventist Review Ministries and research professor of Old Testament and Ancient Near Eastern Studies at Andrews University, was born and raised in Germany.",

    "introduction": "### Introduction to Sexually Designed: Principles of Biblical Sexuality\n\n“Why is ‘the Church’ so bothered about sex? For one thing, the Bible contains many narratives and teachings regarding sexuality. In the primary religious text for Christianity, sexuality is inescapable. Second, in recent years, because of the various approaches in understanding and interpreting the Bible, some Christian denominations have taken several eyebrow-raising stances on diverse sexual issues. After understanding sexuality from the entire Bible and only the Bible, we can see that some of these stances are quite erroneous, if not dangerous in their ramifications! Last, sexuality is so much a part of the human experience that any serious believer will want to understand what the Bible has to say about it.\n\nAfter studying this topic, it may be shocking to see that the Bible is quite positive toward sexuality. Furthermore, the negative tones often associated with the “church” point to the larger problem of misunderstanding and even mishandling of Scripture. It will be clear that God is the Author of sexuality, and its proper understanding may raise eyebrows in another way.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the libertine world, where all forms of morality, restriction, and guidance are considered chaff. Even before the advent of the internet, sexuality and its associated issues started to rise in importance and visibility, commensurate with the expansion of media. Now with the ubiquity of the digital world, sexuality has saturated nearly every sphere of society.\n\nWhere are believers of Jesus and Scripture to stand? It is precisely for the prevalence of misunderstanding biblical sexuality that this quarter will be addressing this taboo subject. No Bible study series can fully exhaust the study of sexuality. It will not comprehensively address every issue, hypothetical and corollary, that is associated with the topic. That task would be too exhaustive and would take more than 13 weeks. Rather the basic principles of sexuality will be drawn out each week, allowing the readers to adapt, apply, and intersect the principles to their own real world. As the discussions regarding sexuality have so many nuances and different contexts, biblical principles will help believers navigate through personal circumstances.\n\nIn this issue of inVerse, the topic of sexuality will be addressed from the perspective of both the Old and New Testaments. It will present the function, purpose, and gift of sexuality that God created and intended for humanity, not as a polemic or an apologetic, but as a study seeking God’s goodness. The first couple of lessons establish the Bible as the prime territory from which our data is mined and where the purpose of sexuality is found. Lesson 3 establishes that although sexuality is a gift from God, its practice is not mandated for all humanity. The next five lessons look at sexuality from the biblical characteristics of goodness, oneness, duality, sameness, and difference. The remaining lessons approach sexuality from other perspectives, seeking to diagnose and provide restorative principles.\n\nIn an era when sexuality is made so common and profane, it is the desire of the authors to increase the dialog regarding sexuality and its associated issues, especially in the arena of the church, Scripture, and faith. It is our desire to explore the holiness of the topic and its true positive purpose for humanity as a gift. Additionally, this topic presents principles presuppositions that will set up future discussions on religious liberty, faith and science, hermeneutics, last-day events, and more.\n\nThis behemoth topic is not meant to be a marriage counseling guide or a textbook on biological and sexual issues. It is not meant as a primer on theological propositions or as a practical handbook. Rather it is presented merely as a starting point for young-adult Christ-followers to take the Bible as a whole, seriously, and, inspired by the Spirit, to find answers to the yearnings of the soul.",
